# Sentiment-Analysis

## This dataset contains Reviews of four different categories, which are The Da Vinci Code, Harry Potter, Brokeback Mountain, Mission:Impossible. I have perform text cleaning such as removing stopwords, punctuation, special character, digits, non-ASCII character. I have used wordcloud to see which word appeared most in dataset. and After removing category name from reviews I have build ML model using TFidfVectorizer and done prediction.
